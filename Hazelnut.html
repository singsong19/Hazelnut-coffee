            <h1>Hazelnut</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups of brewed coffee. You can brew less or more and adjust the ingredients below accordingly. 
                    This recipe is for 4 cups of coffee.</li>
                <li>¼ cup hazelnut flavoring syrup</li>
                <li>1 tbsp. Nutella</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp. ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
                <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream (must add)</li>
                <li>Sugar as per taste. I’d recommend 2 or 3 tsp.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>1. Once you have prepared freshly brewed hot coffee, take a large saucepan and pour the coffee in it.<br>
                2. Now, take the hazelnut flavoring syrup and add it to the saucepan. Also, add sugar and cinnamon.<br>
                3. Heat the saucepan and stir the ingredients thoroughly. Once mixed, pour the mixture equally into four mugs.<br>
                4. Take a small bowl and add cream and Nutella to it. Beat it until thickened.<br>
                5. Finally, add the cream + Nutella on top of the drink and serve immediately.</p>
